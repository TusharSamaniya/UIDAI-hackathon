India has made significant progress in Aadhaar enrolment, achieving broad national coverage over time. However, this progress is uneven across regions, age groups, and levels of access.

While several states and urban areas are nearing enrolment saturation, many districts continue to show low coverage and weak growth. Child enrolment remains a critical gap, threatening long-term inclusion.

The analysis shows that future Aadhaar expansion must shift from mass enrolment campaigns to targeted, district-level interventions. By prioritizing high-risk districts, improving rural access, and integrating child enrolment with existing social programs, UIDAI can ensure inclusive and sustainable Aadhaar coverage across India.
